'''
python is a compiled and interpreted language
why??
the python src code file is first-> compiled into-> bytecode(we need this to achieve portability)-> from here
it is interepreted by a python vm -> to convert to machine language

there are multi[le implememtation of python out there but the one we use us cpython, the other ones are PyPy, Ironpython, jython]
